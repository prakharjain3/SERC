# Chapter 1

* `Actuators` - It is a component of a machine that is responsible for moving and controlling a mechanism or system
* `Fog`
* `EDA (Event-driven Architectures)`
* `MSA (Micros-ervices Architecture)`
* `QoS (Quality of Service)`
* `Proactive` - (of a person or action) creating or controlling a situation rather than just responding to it after it has happened.
* `rule-based algorithms`
  Rule-based classifiers are just another type of classifier which makes the class decision depending by using various “if..else” rules. These rules are easily interpretable and thus these classifiers are generally used to generate descriptive models. The condition used with “if” is called the antecedent and the predicted class of each rule is called the consequent.
* `control theory techniques`
  Control theory is concerned with the analysis and design of a closed-loop control system
  A closed loop control system is a mechanical or electronic device that automatically regulates a system to maintain a desired state or set point without human interaction.
* `model checking`
  Model checking is a technique for determining whether a formal model of a system satisfies a given property
* `model-driven techniques`
* `offlate` - in the recent past
* `context data generated by IoT systems`

Application Layer - An application layer is an abstraction layer that specifies the shared communications protocols and interface methods used by hosts in a communications network.
